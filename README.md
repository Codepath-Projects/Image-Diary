## Overview

### Description

Users can take and save pictures in an online diary where they can write diary entries related to those pictures.

### App Evaluation

   - **Category:** Lifestyle
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is necessary because the user have to use their camera to capture a moment/experience. The users can use geolocation to specify where did they take the picture (a way of remembering).
   - **Story:** An image diary to keep track of all the moments you have throughout your lifetime.
   - **Market:** The user base would be very large because journaling/diary keeping is a very popular past time. Especially if you add the images that go along with it, we could have a user base of young to old, though probably more on the younger side because they are the ones more likely to want an online diary vs a paper one.
   - **Habit:** The users can use this app on a daily basis to write about their day. They are more likely to add images that goes with their diary entries, as a way of looking back at the moments captured in those images.
   - **Scope:** V1 would allow users to take and save photos in their diary and write a diary entry to go along with it. It would show it in a list format from recent to older. V2 would include a calendar view with the images in the specific days so you can look back on your entries. V3 would have a geolocation feature so that you can have a map and see where your images were taken.
