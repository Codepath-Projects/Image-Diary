## Top 3 App Ideas
1. Wardrobe app
    - **Description**: Let's users take pictures of their clothes and match them into outfits. Then you can reference them later when you are trying to find something to wear.
   - **Category:** Beauty and Lifestyle
   - **Mobile:** We can use a camera to take pictures of the clothes. Therefore mobile is necessary. 
   - **Story:** This app would make keeping track of your clothing a lot easier. It provides convenience because you can easily make 
   - **Market:** Our user base is quite large because anybody with clothing can use it. Though, I think the audience most likely to make use of this app are women.  
   - **Habit:** Users can use this app at any time of the day. They can prepare what clothings to wear ahead of time. They can be creative in mixing and matching pieces of clothes they never thought it would work out well.
   - **Scope:** V1 would just include being able to take pictures of your clothes and then add them to your virtual closet. After this, V2 would include being able to actually combine the clothing items to create outfits. 

2. Recycling app
    - **Description**: Users can take pictures of items to see whether they can be recycled or not. They can also keep track of what they have recycled and get rewards when they reach certain milestones.
   - **Category:** Lifestyle
   - **Mobile:** This is best on mobile because the user has to use their camera to take pictures of their items. It could also use geolocation to show where there are places to recycle and where you have recycled before. 
   - **Story:** Encourages the users to recycle, but also educate them on what materials they can or cannot recycle.
   - **Market:** The user base would be large because it would be anybody that would want to recycle. It would generally include young adults and older, who have to clean their houses and recycle items.
   - **Habit:** The users can use their camera to take a picture of their item at any time and place.
   - **Scope:** V1 would allow users to scan their items and see if they are recyclable. V2 would allow users to keep track of what they have recycled and get rewarded based on how much they have recycled. This app would still be good with only V1, however, the likelyhood of being able to implement V1 within the time frame is small.

3. Image Diary
    - **Description**: Users can take and save pictures in an online diary where they can write diary entries related to that pictures.
   - **Category:** Lifestyle
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is necessary because the user have to use their camera to capture a moment/experience. The users can use geolocation to specify where did they take the picture (a way of remembering).
   - **Story:** An image diary to keep track of all the moments you have throughout your lifetime.
   - **Market:** The user base would be very large because journaling/diary keeping is a very popular past time. Especially if you add the images that go along with it, we could have a user base of young to old, though probably more on the younger side because they are the ones more likely to want an online diary vs a paper one.
   - **Habit:** The users can use this app on a daily basis to write about their day. They are more likely to add images that goes with their diary entries, as a way of looking back at the moments captured in those images.
   - **Scope:** V1 would allow users to take and save photos in their diary and write a diary entry to go along with it. It would show it in a list format from recent to older. V2 would include a calendar view with the images in the specific days so you can look back on your entries. V3 would have a geolocation feature so that you can have a map and see where your images were taken.

## Final Idea:
Image Diary!
